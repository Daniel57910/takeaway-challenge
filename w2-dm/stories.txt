So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered

require './lib/app.rb'
c = Customer.new
c.select(45)
 
c.show_total

d = Customer.new
d.select(50)
d.show_total
